					<h1>Some thoughts about advanced internet programming</h1>
					<hr/>
					<h2>Preface</h2>
                    <p>This just my personal thoughts about my current doing subject “Advanced internet programming”, this article wasn’t armed for aggressive or targeted to any individual teacher, in here I just want to criticize fairly and justify about the issue i found in design and the horrible experiences that I faced as a student in this subject.</p>
                    <h2>Records</h2>
                    <p>
                        in this semester, I’ve studied a subject called “Advanced Internet Programming”, yeah, it’s an “Advanced” subject. so this subject will assume you got the basic knowledge about internet programming, won’t go through each of them step by step.
                        I understand the expectation of this course, it’s standing on the perspective of “Professional” developer, however, by doing through this subject over the semester, I felt totally fooled about the definition of the “Professional” developer are, all I found is totally non-important instructions.
                        here’s the example of how the important instructions vs useless “Truth” that everybody knows.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        the part in red is where I think is useless, the part in green is where I think is useful instructions.

                        the reason is,

                        firstly till now is week 8, everyone knows there’s not much time left because we got the only 3 weeks left to finish all the work for the assignment 3, furthermore, the details flow of how assignment 3 will be assess is already clearly mentioned in the assignment 3 PDF instructions, so to mentions it in here again I think is totally useless and waste my time to read it.

                        secondly, this part is where I think most ridiculous useless instructions

                        How much of your system is complete? 50%? 80%? 90%? How can you know for sure?

                        It just throws a problem for me about criticizing our progress for assignment 3, then you tell me it’s difficult to measure the progress blah blah blah… so how to measure? I know as a “Professional” developer point of view, I need to find out by myself, that is kind of “common sense” things. why you want to talk about this in here, besides, I don’t really think its relevant to the lab challenge at all. so if this is for the tips, or I guessing is the issue that you want to throw about assignment 3, please please please throw everything once over there, in the assignment 3 project instruction PDF. so the “Motivation” to have kinds of this instructions, it just makes me felt a big mess, rather than being “Motivated”.
